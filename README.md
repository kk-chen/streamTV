# streamTV

This is a database project provides the front-end of a website for a fictional streamTV service that allows customers to register, search through the available shows, add shows to their queue, and watch episodes from shows that they have queued.

The project can be accessed at http://vapplez.vps.cs.uri.edu/streamTV
